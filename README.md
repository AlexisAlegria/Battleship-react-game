# :bomb::collision::fire: Battleship React Game :anchor:

## This version

This Battleship game version is based on Andreea Nastase's work. To accomplish the deadline for this challenge I've used the Andreea's React strategy.

Despite of above, I customized the whole Pages Styling and introduce some functionalities that the original project didn't have.

## :seedling: Installation

- if you are doing a local installation you have to do the following steps manually:

```sh
clon this repo to your desktop
cd battleship
npm start
```

## :point right: Next Steps

For time reasons, I have two pending items:

- Fire button
- Show hidden ships button
